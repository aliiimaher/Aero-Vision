# YOLO Pose Estimation

This project implements a pose estimation system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework, specifically tailored for detecting and estimating human poses in images. The implementation includes functionalities for dataset handling, model training, and validation, allowing for flexibility and customization.


## Dataset Preparation

The dataset is a crucial component of the training process. It consists of images and corresponding annotations that indicate the keypoints for pose estimation. To prepare the dataset:

1. **Directory Structure**: Organize your dataset into a specific directory structure. Create a main directory that contains an `images` folder for storing your image files and a `labels` folder for storing the corresponding annotation files. Each image should have a matching label file that contains the keypoint data.

2. **Annotation Format**: The label files should be in a format that can be easily read by the program, such as pickle format. Ensure that the annotations are accurate and correspond correctly to the images to avoid training errors.


## Training the Model

Training the YOLO pose estimation model involves several key steps:

1. **Configuration**: Create a configuration file, typically in YAML format, where you specify various parameters needed for training. This includes the path to the pre-trained model, the task type, dataset location, and other hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

2. **Execution**: Initiate the training process by running the training script. During training, the model will learn to detect and estimate poses based on the provided dataset. Monitor the training progress through logs or visualizations to ensure that the model is learning effectively.

3. **Checkpointing**: It is advisable to implement model checkpointing, which allows you to save the model's state at regular intervals. This way, if the training process is interrupted, you can resume from the last saved state without losing progress.

## Validating the Model

Validation is an essential step to evaluate the performance of the trained model:

1. **Integrated Validation**: The validation process is typically integrated into the training loop. After each epoch, the model is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance. This helps in monitoring overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

2. **Custom Validation Scripts**: If desired, you can implement separate validation scripts using custom validators. This allows for more detailed analysis of the model's predictions, including visualizations of predicted keypoints on images.

3. **Performance Metrics**: During validation, track performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will provide insights into how well the model is performing and highlight areas for improvement.

## Usage

After successfully training the model, you can use it for inference on new images:

1. **Loading the Model**: Load the trained model from the saved checkpoint. Ensure that the model is correctly initialized and configured for inference.

2. **Making Predictions**: Input new images into the model to obtain predictions. The model will output keypoint coordinates, which can be further processed for visualization or analysis.

3. **Visualization**: Implement visualization techniques to display the predicted keypoints on the images. This will help in assessing the model's performance visually and understanding its strengths and weaknesses.
